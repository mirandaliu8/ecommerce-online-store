# E-Commerce Online Store

Created a full-stack application using agile methodology in collaboration with a team. The back-end was developed through the use of Java, REST API, and SQL, while the front-end was developed through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and responsive design.

## Application

This application allows authorized consumer users to view product details and add, update, and delete products in their shopping cart, as well as view their subtotal and cart total. Originally starting out as a command line application, the functionality was then expanded into an online setting. Customers can also view the list of available products and search for specific items.
